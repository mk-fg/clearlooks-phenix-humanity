Overview
--------

Original `Clearlooks-Phénix project`_ by `Jean-Philippe Fleury`_ is a GTK3 port
of old GTK2/GNOME2 `Clearlooks style`_.

This project is an adaptation of that to look like old Ubuntu Human-Murrine
GTK2 theme, which can be found here too (gtk-2.0 dir) or in e.g. `Human Quarny theme`_.

This was a part of conversion project, which continues in `luigifab/human-theme`_
repository, please go there for a much more complete, working and up-to-date
version of this theme.

Templating (.tpl.css files)
---------------------------

To avoid going insane from 100+ line selectors, simple custom templating is used
to transform \*.tpl.css into \*.css files via `css-templater.py`_ script
(requires python3 and `textX module`_ to run).

Both source and destination files are in the repo, so it should be irrelevant
for simple theme usage, only for editing it.

Templating is intended to keep css clean and explicit wrt what is defined where.

All templating rules are processed from regular css statements with ``-ext``
selector, taking both selectors and rules there into account, removing these
sections afterwards.

Supported templating rules:

- ``-x-same-rules``::

    toolbar button:toggle -ext { -x-same-rules: button:checked; }

  Apply all rules specified for one selector ("button:checked" above) to another.

  For logical grouping of elements sharing same rules, for example to have all
  rules relating to "toolbar" buttons together, instead of spreading them as
  selector prefixes all over the place.

- ``-x-same-rules-all``::

    button.flat -ext { -x-same-rules-all: toolbar button; }

  Applies all the same rules as for "toolbar button" to "button.flat", including
  e.g. "toolbar button:toggle" rule above (will be used for "button.flat:toggle"),
  as well as any rules for child/descendant elements.

  Kinda like search-copy-replace for all selectors where "toolbar button" is used.
  Can be used for many-to-many replacements, with any number of selectors on either side, not just one.

  Some elements are styled in the same way, and this allows to do it with just
  one line, instead of duplicating a list of these in every selector forever.

- ``-x-var-*``::

    -ext {
      -x-var-bg-glow:
        radial-gradient(
          ellipse 90% 50%,
          @button_glaze_glow_center,
          @button_glaze_glow_edge );
      -x-var-border-rules:
        border-width: 1px\
        border-color: red\
        border-style: solid\;
    }

    ...

    button {
      -x-var-border-rules
      background:
        -x-var-bg-glow,
        linear-gradient(to bottom,
          @button_glaze_top,
          @button_glaze_mid-a 49%,
          @button_glaze_mid-b 49%,
          @button_glaze_bot );
    }

  Simple non-nested variable substitution, which works for any strings in any context.

  I.e. with ``-x-var-bg-glow`` definition in-place, ``(?<=[^-\w])-x-var-bg-glow(?=[^-\w])``
  will be replaced in css everywhere via re.sub(). Note the non-word/dash delimiters.

  Use ``\`` to have ``;`` in the replacement string and ``\\`` to get literal backslash.

Run e.g. ``diff -uw gtk-3.0/buttons{.tpl,}.css`` for a more concrete
transformation examples.
css-templater.py also prints diffs with -v/--verbose option.

Other common CSS templating system - SASS/SCSS - doesn't handle all use-cases
above well, unfortunately, hence this custom system.

Common differences between Clearlooks GTK3 vs Human GTK2
--------------------------------------------------------

All of these apply to looks after Gtk3 translation, with rough guess at which
original styles resulted in those looks, as per murrine_draw_rgba.c and such.

- Background gradients

  Clearlooks uses "glassy" glazed toolbars/menubars, with two gradients going up
  and down vertically from the base background color in the center.

  Human theme uses "gradient" toolbarstyle=2 menubarstyle=2 and such, which are
  simplier top-to-shade(0.95)-darker-bottom gradients.

- Borders

  GTK3 Clearlooks translation uses shades of @theme_selected_bg for borders,
  while murrine engine's colors->shade[n] values derive shades from normal background,
  which have different hues in Human Quarny.

  Border size/presence do not seem to correspond very well either - e.g. all
  separators in Human have borders, but not in this GTK3 Clearlooks theme.

- Borders on :disabled (insensitive) elements have highlight "shadow" in GTK2
  Human via reliefstyle=2, which can probably be replicated in some/most places
  via GTK3 box-shadow.

- Menus and similar popup-windows drop shadows on surrounding elements in GTK2,
  which can probably be emulated via box-shadow behind menu with transparent
  "decoration" padding or other margins to make space for it.

- All scrollbars are not pop-up overlays in GTK2, and are always present,
  instead of only when hovering over scrolled element(s), which can be replicated in GTK3
  via GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING=0 env var (set in e.g. /etc/environment or session manager).


Notes on adapting murrine-engine GTK2 theme to GTK3
---------------------------------------------------

- Get the source code for Murrine and GTK2 theme in question:

  - `Murrine-0.98.2 GTK2 Theming Engine source at ftp.gnome.org`_ (https, not actual ftp)
  - gtk-2.0/gtkrc file in this repo

  .. _Murrine-0.98.2 GTK2 Theming Engine source at ftp.gnome.org: https://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/murrine/0.98/murrine-0.98.2.tar.xz

- gtkrc in GTK2 style has main color definitions, e.g.::

    gtk_color_scheme = "fg_color:#101010\nbg_color:#E6DDD5\n
      base_color:#FFF\ntext_color:#1A1A1A\nselected_bg_color:#8F5F4A\n
      selected_fg_color:#FFF\ntooltip_bg_color:#F5F5B5\ntooltip_fg_color:#000"

    ...

    fg[NORMAL]        = @fg_color
    fg[PRELIGHT]      = @fg_color
    fg[ACTIVE]        = @fg_color
    fg[SELECTED]      = @selected_fg_color
    fg[INSENSITIVE]   = shade (0.65, @bg_color)

    bg[NORMAL]        = @bg_color
    bg[PRELIGHT]      = shade (1.02, @bg_color)
    bg[ACTIVE]        = shade (0.88, @bg_color)
    bg[SELECTED]      = @selected_bg_color
    bg[INSENSITIVE]   = @bg_color

    ...

  Note that base colors are defined in "gtk_color_scheme =", and pretty much all
  others derive from those.

  GTK3 supports same shade() and mix() color expressions as GTK2 - see `GTK+ CSS
  Overview - Colors`_ section for details.

  .. _GTK+ CSS Overview - Colors: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/chap-css-overview.html#id-1.5.2.3.8

- murrine_style.c has murrine_style_realize, where most intermediate colors are
  defined, and are later used to draw widgets in murrine_draw_rgba.c and such.

  For example, murrine_rgba_draw_progressbar_fill draws animated
  diagonally-striped progress bars with following color definitions::

    MurrineRGB border = colors->spot[2];
    MurrineRGB effect;
    MurrineRGB fill = colors->spot[1];

    murrine_get_fill_color (&fill, &widget->mrn_gradient);
      // murrine_get_fill_color:
      //   if (mrn_gradient->has_gradient_colors)
      //     murrine_mix_color (&mrn_gradient->gradient_colors[1],
      //                        &mrn_gradient->gradient_colors[2],
      //                        0.5, color);
      // -- Note: gradient colors from gtkrc, if any

    murrine_shade (&fill, murrine_get_contrast(0.65, widget->contrast), &effect);
      // murrine_get_contrast:
      //   if (factor < 1.0) if (old < 1.0) return old+(1.0-old)*(1.0-factor);
      // -- Note: contrast factor defined in gtkrc, can be per-widget or global

    ...

    murrine_draw_glaze (cr, &fill,
      widget->glow_shade, widget->highlight_shade, widget->lightborder_shade, ...

    /* Draw strokes */
    ...
    murrine_set_color_rgba (cr, &effect, 0.15);
    cairo_fill (cr);

    /* Draw border */
    murrine_mix_color (&border, &fill, 0.28, &border);
    murrine_draw_border (cr, &border, ...

  Where "spot" colors are defined in murrine_style_realize as::

    double spots[] = {1.42, 1.00, 0.65};

    contrast = MURRINE_RC_STYLE (style->rc_style)->contrast;
    spots[2] = murrine_get_contrast(spots[2], contrast);

    spot_color = style->bg[GTK_STATE_SELECTED];
    murrine_shade (&spot_color, spots[0], &murrine_style->colors.spot[0]);
    murrine_shade (&spot_color, spots[1], &murrine_style->colors.spot[1]);
    murrine_shade (&spot_color, spots[2], &murrine_style->colors.spot[2]);

  Given "contrast = 0.9" in gtkrc, intermediate "spot" colors can be translated
  to GTK3 definitions as:

  - m_spot_0 shade(@selected_bg_color, 1.42);
  - m_spot_1 shade(@selected_bg_color, 1.00);
  - m_spot_2 shade(@selected_bg_color, 0.65 + (1 - 0.65) * (1 - 0.9) = 0.685);

  And actual fill / effect / border colors will be:

  - progressbar_fill @m_spot_1;
  - progressbar_effect alpha(shade(@progressbar_fill, 0.685), 0.15);
  - progressbar_border mix(@m_spot_2, @progressbar_fill, 0.28);

- background-image of that widget will be a bunch of gradients, as described by
  murrine_draw_glaze() in cairo-support.c - see `murrine-notes.txt`_ for rough
  translation.

- Stripes are semi-transparent sharp repeating-linear-gradient on top.

- Border is drawn with color from above translation.

`gtk-color-translate.py`_ script can be used to get result for various GTK3 color
expressions, e.g. ``./gtk-color-translate.py 'shade(#8f5f4a, 1.5)'`` -> ``#cf9277``.

See `murrine-notes.txt`_ for more details on how specific widget looks are composed.

GTK+ Theming Documentation/Tool Links
-------------------------------------

- AWF_ (A Widget Factory) - tool to display GTK2/GTK3 themed widgets side-by-side.

  `awf-gtk3-wrapper.py`_ script can be used to start it with GTK_THEME and
  timestamped logging for output (theme syntax errors) and reload events,
  which can be triggered either by SIGQUIT (e.g. sent via ^\ in terminal) or SIGHUP,
  and debounced, in case they're triggered by e.g. staggered fanotify signals
  (sent by "fatrace-run_ -p ~user/.themes/clearlooks-phenix-humanity -f 'WD<>' --
  pkill -QUIT -F /tmp/awf-gtk3.pid" fatrace_ wrapper here).

  Specify -t/--rebuild-templates option for awf-gtk3-wrapper.py to also rebuild
  .css files from .tpl.css changes via `css-templater.py`_ script next to it.

  Similar tool included in GTK3 (might be in gtk-3-examples or somesuch
  package) - gtk3-widget-factory - has even more gtk3-specific widgets on display.

  Local `gtk-widget-demo.py`_ script can also be used to test some widgets or
  elements that are hard to find in other demo apps, e.g. horizontal scrollbars.

  .. _gtk-widget-demo.py: gtk-widget-demo.py

- `magnus (local fork with color tweaks)`_ - simple tool to zoom-in on and
  compare small theme elements.

  Allows to freeze-compare zoomed elements side-by-side and also applies
  color tweaks to source pixels, to map relatively limited color ranges of this theme
  to a much large output color range, making e.g. various small border/gradient details
  much easier to distinguish visually (esp. on cheap displays).

- `GTK+ CSS Overview`_ - outlines what is possible in GTK3 CSS.
- `GTK+ CSS Properties`_ - reference for all supported CSS properties.

- `GTK+ Inspector`_ - "CSS" tab there allows to easily paste/override/test theme
  parts on the fly.

  .. container:: gtk-inspector-on-ubuntu-mate
    :name: gtk-inspector-on-ubuntu-mate

    To enable hotkeys for inspector in all apps on e.g. Ubuntu MATE (so that you
    can press Ctrl+Shift+I and show info on any element on mate-panel, same as
    with inspector hotkeys in browsers), follow `this guide on ubuntu-mate.community`_,
    gist of which is:

    - Install libgtk-3-dev: ``sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev``
    - Enable inspector keys: ``gsettings set org.gtk.Settings.Debug enable-inspector-keybinding true``
    - Reboot
    - Hover over any GTK3 app/panel element and press Ctrl+Shift+I or Ctrl+Shift+D

    Alternative is setting GTK_DEBUG=interactive env var for specific apps, or
    to /etc/environment to have inspector window open automatically for every window.

    Latter trick (``echo GTK_DEBUG=interactive >> /etc/environment``) can be
    useful to debug some panel widgets where Ctrl+Shift+I doesn't work and which
    are created in a complicated way.

- `Clearlooks-Phénix theme`_ - GTK3 theme which this rework is based on,
  as it looks quite like Human-Murrine GTK2 (which itself was based on
  Clearlooks), but with Clearlooks-y colors/effects.

- `Murrine GTK2 Theming Engine`_ - GTK2 engine that draws all widgets in
  Ubuntu Human-Murrine GTK2 theme (via `cairo graphics library`_).
